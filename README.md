# dino-dex
Inspired by Pokémon’s 3rd-gen Pokédex, Dinodex is a digital encyclopedia for dinosaurs.
The goal is to make information on dinosaurs easily available in a user-friendly environment while maintaining scientific accuracy — without the “goofy” presentation often used in children’s material.

Features 
Searchable dinosaur database (name, era, diet, size, etc.)
Individual dinosaur pages with scientific details
Community-driven accuracy — users can suggest corrections or improvements
Designed to balance accessibility with scientific reliability

Why Dinodex?
-Information about dinosaurs often varies across sources. This project aims to:
-Collect, organize, and present accurate data
-Provide an approachable but non-childish interface
-Encourage community input for error-checking and knowledge sharing

Roadmap
Phase 1: Dinosaur dataset + API
Phase 2: Simple web interface (search + browse)
Phase 3: UI enhancements, images, filtering, and more
